# Pesquisa

## This project was inspired from the [wvim](https://ctoomey.com/writing/which-plus-vim-wvim/ "Visit Chris Toomey website")

Since I use Bash as my shell, I've decided to port it to that shell. It's not fully done yet, but will be soon.

### Description

Pesquisa is a shellscript that localizes bash functions, bash aliases, and git-aliases.
It looks inside .bashrc, .gitconfig and a directory called Shellscripts that must be created.

To source the script, it can be done temporarily by exporting it to PATH or permanently in .bashrc.
